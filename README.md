## Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict the total pay of employees based on different attributes, including job titles, years of experience, and more. We use a Decision Tree Regression model for this purpose.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need Python and the following libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone < https://github.com/prashantkparth/Salary_Prediction_with_DecisionTree >
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Salary_Prediction_with_DecisionTree
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to analyze the salary data and train the Decision Tree Regression model.

## Data

We used the "Salaries.csv" dataset for this project. The dataset contains information about employee salaries, job titles, and more. Make sure to update the data source if you want to use a different dataset.

## Machine Learning

We utilized scikit-learn to build a Decision Tree Regression model. The code includes data preprocessing steps, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.

```python
# Example code for training the model and making predictions
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Load and preprocess the data
# ...

# Create and train the Decision Tree Regression model
model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
model.fit(inputs_new, target)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict([[3]])
```

Feel free to explore the code in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for more details.
